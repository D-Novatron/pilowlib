'''PiLowLib is a library that provides low level access to the
peripherals of the Raspberry PI. Currently, besides the raw access
to the registers, the following peripherals are supported:
    * simple digital I/O
    * PWM
    * clocks
    
Parts of this library were inspired from the wiringPi project
written by Gordon Henderson.
