PiLowLib is a library that provides low level access to the
peripherals of the Raspberry PI. Currently, besides the raw access
to the registers, the following peripherals are supported:
    * simple digital I/O
    * PWM
    * clocks

PiLowLib is fast and performant due to the fact that
it uses direct access to the Raspberry PI's
peripherals registers. Moreover, it's completely
written in Python and does not need any C compiling.

To get started take a look over the examples directory.

PiLowLib was written by Calin Crisan <ccrisan@gmail.com>
and is released under LGPLv3 license.

Parts of this library were inspired from the wiringPi project
written by Gordon Henderson.
